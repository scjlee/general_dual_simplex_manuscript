## 2026-10-09 — Start the manuscript repository with setup only and a new history

Context: the user split `scjlee/dual_simplex_functional` into three
independent repositories: experiments (full history kept), the
`GeneralDualSimplex` R package, and this manuscript repository. The
decisions behind the split are in the experiment repository's
`artifact/decisions.md`, entries from 2026-10-05 and 2026-10-09.

Options: start the manuscript from the old tracked TeX file, or start
empty. The old TeX file is a slide deck, not a paper draft.

Decision (user, 2026-10-05): setup only. This repository starts a new
history with a README, agent rules, this record and local tools. It does
not inherit the slide deck. No manuscript format or scientific content is
chosen yet.

Evidence: at setup, the experiment transition branch is at
`fe436483d4f394d3312d4bf02cd9938ab534fe3b`, and GeneralDualSimplex 0.1.0
is at `aa2717e59b098bcc31995d3dde5ab021aca6d087`. Its 13 standalone
reports were rendered at that experiment commit; the old and new reports
agree on every verdict.

Revisit if: the user chooses a manuscript format, or the experiment
repository is renamed on GitHub (README names it
`scjlee/dual_simplex_functional`).
